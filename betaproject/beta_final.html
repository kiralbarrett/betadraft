        <p> While building a tiny home, these are the questions that people ask each other. For these DIY builders, the responses are crucial. In Facebook groups, at conferences and meetups, people building their own tiny homes seek advice.</p>
  <p>Tiny Homes are an answer to inflated city living prices, the growing trend of childless adults in their 20s, and even climate change. “Going tiny” means not only giving up most of your possessions, but dedicating months to working with your hands. This can be not only satisfying, but practical.</>
    <p>Frank Levesque, 30, and his wife agreed that because they spent most of their time outdoors, their normal-sized home wasn’t necessary.</p>
  <p>“We are both always trying to be environmentally friendly so downsizing made sense,” said Levesque. “Both my wife and I had separately always planned on building a tiny home before we met.” </p>
  <p>Levesque says that although he’s an electrical contractor by trade, the building process takes a village -- including both him and his wife’s parents, as well as additional resources and research. </p>

<p>In 2018, the International Code Council added a “Tiny House” <a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IRC2018/appendix-q-tiny-houses?site_type=public" target=_blank> appendix</a>, making it possible for citizens in all U.S. states to build their own tiny houses. This council is known to lag behind building trends, like the federal courts of their industry. The tiny house craze began 20 years ago, and while people have been building tiny homes since then, 2018 was the first year that tiny house occupants could officially build their houses as such under ICC regulation, without registering them as normal homes or RVs.Tiny houses are more than just small homes. These houses are often built on wheels and built by their occupants. They can be bought and sold through private builders, websites, or even Facebook groups. They’re often conceived through DIY communities committed to crowdsourcing advice.
<p>Official regulation says they must be smaller than 400 sq ft, about the size of a studio apartment or a typical two car garage.</p>

<p>It took the ICC years to catch up to this 21st century building model. Still, some states — like New York — have regulations that do now allow temporary structures like tiny homes or trailers at all. Other cities, like Seattle, are <a href="https://lihi.org/tiny-houses/" target=_blank> promoting </a>tiny homes as a way to house the homeless. </p>

        <h3>What defines a tiny home?</h3>

<p>By appearance, they’re not RV’s, and they’re not trailers; but they also don’t have all the characteristics of a house. Many do exist on wheels, designed to be flexible for their owners, allowing them to settle anywhere in the country temporarily. The average cost to construct a tiny home is $23,000, though some more luxurious options can run close to six figures. Many people still don’t know about this growing trend and community in pursuit of “going tiny,” despite multiple TV shows, tens of building companies and thousands of online forums, websites, Facebook groups and Youtube channels about the phenomena.
The DIY tiny house trend is becoming so mainstream that you almost forget that each of these people have spent months, maybe years, drawing up architectural plans, sourcing building materials, and constructing a small home from scratch. Why did this trend take off?

          <p>The process of building a tiny house is almost equivalent to building an entire home, something that the majority of Americans don’t attempt, according to <a href="http://blog.armchairbuilder.com/9159/how-many-people-built-their-own-home-in-2014/" target=_blank> 2014 U.S. Census data.</a></p>
  <p>The most common motivation for going tiny is escaping 21st century consumerism. At a time when Americans are spending more and more time staring at screens, building a tiny home is a unique rebellion. </p>

        <h3> It takes a village. </h3>

    <p>Rahn Sidebotham, 64, began building for different reasons. As a retiree, he wanted to experience cross country travel. He spent two years building his tiny house in Sonoma, California. It is now parked on a beach in Mexico.
While he had little to no construction experience, he said that the support of the DIY community made it possible. He met folks through a conference, put on by the Tumbleweed Tiny House company, founded in 1999.
“The Tumbleweed conference just cemented the idea that this was doable,” Sidebotham said. “I believe that if you want to, you can build without having contracting or architectural experience.” </p>

    <p>The conference inspired him to attend a meetup group with other tiny house builders he had heard about. The group was led by a tiny house builder with a wood shop. Sidebotham and others spent time creating blueprints and getting advice.
On Facebook, thousands are motivated by their fellow builders, all willing to lend a hand or most likely, leave a comment. The wealth of resources aided Sidebotham in each step of the process.
“I enjoyed the process and would consider building a second one, if the opportunity arises,” said Sidebotham, who even united with his son, an electrician, for part of the process.
Sidebotham is not the only one who feels this way. Tiny house builders all over the country have found community through this process.
As the description of one Facebook group -- Tiny House Life -- says, “This group is designed to help surround you with people who ‘get’ you. The Tiny House Life is a community of Do It Yourselfers, Minimalists, Environmentalists, Adventurers and Builders coming together in one place.” </p>
